# Server-Rush-Times
This application descirbes a query/insertion interface that allow client machines to record rush hours in a server and then query a timestamp to check if its a rush hour or not. The solution is asymptotically linear with the current description and limitations, but can be improved to constant query time with a few modifications and some space sacrifice.
